"In the year 9YW, orcs were an ancient race, but new to the Great Continent. "
"When the tribe ruled by Pash-Grod made landfall, the Wesnothians had already "
"learned to fear orcish brutality. The inhabitants of one settlement "
"presented the orcs with gold and promised to find more if they were allowed "
"to live. Pash-Grod accepted their bribe and moved his people away from the "
"crowded coast. As they went, Pash-Grod offered the same arrangement to other "
"humans because he had grown fond of gold and wanted more of the shiny metal. "
"Of course he wasn't sharing, and the other members of his tribe could not "
"see any benefit to leaving humans unmolested. Some grumbled, but not too "
"loudly."

"The tribe followed trails of their people around the Heart Mountains and "
"then north, but they found that much of the territory was already claimed by "
"other orcs. Pash-Grod didn't want trouble with his own race, so they kept "
"moving north until finally, they found a home in a cave with a small forest "
"nearby. Pash-Grod settled down and sent wolf riders south to collect more "
"treasure from the humans. As they filled the cave, many orcs wondered aloud "
"why they hadn't settled in one of the nicer areas they had passed. The "
"grumbling got louder until everyone knew that a new leader would have the "
"support of the tribe. It was just a question of which clan was going to "
"challenge Pash-Grod first...."
